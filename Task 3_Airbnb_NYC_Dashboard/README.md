## NYC Airbnb Insights 2024Â 
### Project Overview:
This repository contains the Task 3 deliverables from my Data Analytics Internship Project, focusing on analyzing Airbnb listings in New York City. The goal of this analysis was to generate actionable insights for business stakeholders regarding room type distribution, price trends, market share, reviews, and county-wise dynamics.

### Key Analyses Performed:
1. Total Listings by Room Type & County: Breakdown of listings across room types (Entire home/apt, Private room, Shared room, Hotel room) and NYC boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island).
2. Average Price vs. County (Treemap) : Visual representation of average prices across different counties, highlighting price concentration in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
3. Room Type Market share (Donut Chart) : Market share comparison of different room types by total number of listings.
4. Top 5 Counties by Key Metrics: Ranking boroughs based on metrics like total reviews, average price, reviews per listing, and total listings.
5. Monthly Trend of Reviews (Line Chart) : Quarterly trend analysis showing seasonality in reviews and identifying periods of high demand.

### Key Business Insights:
1. Entire Home/Apt is the most dominant room type, with over 12K listings.
2. Manhattan leads in terms of both highest pricing and consistent review counts.
3. Brooklyn has high total reviews and serves as a strong market with slightly more affordable pricing.
4. Demand spikes significantly in Q4, indicating a seasonal surge in reviews.
5. Smaller boroughs like Queens and Staten Island show potential growth areas but at comparatively lower price points.
